Arign√©e
=======

A Web-Application for automated evaluations of e-commerce websites.

Background
==========

This Application is Part of my Bachelor Thesis I for the Bachelor of Science in Computing Degree Programme.

You can get some information on my [Bachelor I Blog](www.dary.info/blog/bac1).

API
===

Arignee uses a ReST-API witch which Website-evaluations can be triggered and evaluation results can be retained.

I use a ticketing system that takes advantage of the non-blocking I/O of Play!
Get some more information about that on my Blog!

| You request                |     You get |
|:---------------------------|------------:|
| **/eval/?url=[website to evaluate]** | A ticket-number. Your evaluation request is queued and asynchronously started on the server as soon as Play! is ready to process it.
| **/ticket/[ticket-number]** | Either a ticket-number and the status for this ticket or the evaluation result if it's already available.*
| **/history/?url=[website to get evaluation history from]** | All evaluation results for this URL with the according date when the result was created|
*For the first time after the evaluation result is available, you get some additional information with the results. After that you receive a distilled version without any text.


Install
=======

**Build from Source**

If you want to build Arignee from the source on your own machine you need the Play! Framework installed (see Technologies). You should be able to deploy it by simply running the activator script in the root folder.

    ./activator run

However, you need an application.conf file in the /conf folder. (Tip: Try renaming the travis.conf file to application.conf, that might work).

Also you need a Database (I use PostgreSQL).

Last but not least, you might have to download some libraries (see Libraries) that are not automatically downloaded or integrated.

I will give some more detailed instructions on building the project once I'be got a working release.


**Running the Compiled Application**

I will upload the compiled application and give installation instructions once I've got a working release.

Technologies
============

- [Play-Framework 2.3.0](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.0/Home) - A Java Web-Framework

- [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) - Relational Database

Libraries
=========

Arignee depends on some vendor Libraries that are not included in the GIT repository.

**The JS libraries that are not included via CDN need to be downloaded and copied in the according directory**

**Java:**

Those libraries are automatically downloaded from a Ivy repository, since they
are listed in the build.sbt file.

- [Jsoup](http://jsoup.org/) v1.8.1 - Java HTML Parser

- [JSON in Java](http://www.json.org/java/)

- [Play-JSMessages](https://github.com/julienrf/play-jsmessages) v1.6.2 - Send localized Strings (i18n) to client

- [PostgreSQL JDBC Driver](http://jdbc.postgresql.org/) v9.1

**Javacript/CSS:**

- [Chart.js](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js) v1.0.1 - **!! Download** chart.js.min **and copy to** /public/javascripts/vendors
